# Known Issues

- `!skip` command can act strangely, including not tallying votes properly and getting stuck looping the "Sorry, no one voted!" reply even if votes were cast.

- Using any command with a space between the prefix and command (e.g. `! help`, `! play music`) triggers the delete command with no arguments given.

- Not entirely sure this is possible, but I'm going to find out if it's possible to make the `!fellas` command usable while a music queue is playing.
